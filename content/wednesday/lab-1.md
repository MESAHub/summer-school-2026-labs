## How to destroy a White Dwarf in 10(ish) easy steps!

Note throughout this lab expected tasks are outlayed specifically with: 
| 📋 TASK 0 |
|:--------|
| (insert stuff to do here) |

Additionally, there will be various

{{< details title="and hints (click me)" closed="true" >}}
to help you along.
{{< /details >}}

Values that need to be altered in the files will generally be marked with `!!!!!`, but feel free to look over the provided solutions if you get stuck!


### Step 0: Start Up

| 📋 TASK 1 |
|:--------|
| **Download** the starting point from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pht6YvypYnXKGyDYzHVphCF7SZQ7MYAL?usp=drive_link) to a local working directory. |

This starting point is a standard set of MESA files complete with a precomputed 1.1 M<sub>&#9737;</sub> Oxygen-Neon (ONe) white dwarf model.

After downloading, your working directory should look like:

{{< filetree/container >}}
  {{< filetree/folder name="Starting Point" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="clean" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="mk" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="re" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="rn" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="history_columns.list" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="profile_columns.list" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="inlist" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="inlist_common" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="inlist_accrete" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="inlist_pgstar" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="1.1Msun_ONe.mod" >}}
    {{< filetree/folder name="src" state="open" >}}
      {{< filetree/file name="run.f90" >}}
      {{< filetree/file name="run_star_extras.f90" >}}
    {{< /filetree/folder >}}
  {{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< /filetree/container >}} 

At this stage, we are now ready to dive into some inlists!


### Step 1: Inlist

`inlist` serves as a direction point for the run, guiding the order and precedence of variables in various other inlist files. Given this, take a peak at `inlist`. What is the order that other inlists will be read? 

> [!NOTE]
> There is no task for this step! 


### Step 2: Inlist Common

`inlist_common` holds the set of defaults that we want to be common between various accretion runs. The primary point of this is to make changes to runs easier and more modular. Instead of having to sort through walls of variables for each change, the core functionality can be stored in... common.

Now let's look over the file. You will notice that some variables have already been set to help to more aggressively relax tolerance and help the model converge at later times.

{{< details title="Aside on miscellanous variable choices in `inlist_common`" closed="true" >}}
The work that will be done throughout this lab requires careful consideration of input physics for real science cases. !!! TODO !!!

{{< /details >}}

Starting with the top of the file, reset the initial age, reset the initial model number, turn on pgstar, and save our final model as `NAME`. TODO

| 📋 TASK 1 |
|:--------|
| In `&star_jobs`, **update `inlist_common`** to set initial age to 0, set initial model number to 0, turn on pgstar, and save our final model as `NAME` TODO|


{{< details title="Hint: What variables need to be changed?" closed="true" >}}
The parameters that should be updated/added are:
- `save_model_when_terminate`
- `save_model_filename`
- `set_initial_age`
- `initial_age`
- `set_initial_model_number`
- `initial_model_number`
- `pgstar_flag`

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Partial Solution" closed="true" >}}
```fortran
! save a model at the end of the run
    save_model_when_terminate = .false. !!!!!
    save_model_filename = ''            !!!!!

  ! initial model
    set_initial_age = .true. !!!!!
    initial_age = 0d0        !!!!!

    set_initial_model_number = .true. !!!!!
    initial_model_number = 0          !!!!!

  ! display on-screen plots
    pgstar_flag = .true.          !!!!!
    disable_pgstar_during_relax_flag = .false.
```
{{< /details >}}

Next, we want to record the point of oxygen ignition in the white dwarf, but **DO NOT** want to try running through explosion/collapse during these labs. Set the maximum temperature of the model to 10<sup>9.1</sup> K. 

| 📋 TASK 1 |
|:--------|
| In `&controls`, **update `inlist_common`** to stop the model once temperature reaches 10<sup>9.1</sup> K |

{{< details title="Hint: What variables need to be changed?" closed="true" >}}
The parameter that should be added is:
- `log_max_temp_upper_limit`

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Partial Solution" closed="true" >}}
```fortran
! when to stop

     log_max_temp_upper_limit = 9.1d0 !!!!!
```
{{< /details >}}

> [!WARNING]
> Don't forget to save your changes to the inlist!


### Step 3: Inlist Accrete

With the common variables set, now we can focus on the fun part: throwing material on the surface. We will control the reaction network of the model and the material accreted within `inlist_accrete`. Unlike our previous inlist, this file has been provided mostly empty. 

Starting in `&star_jobs`, load in the downloaded model `1.1Msun_ONe.mod`, change the initial network to a file we will later create called `ONe.net`, and set the weak rates to those of Suzuki+2016[^1]. These Suzuki rates are critical for the treatment of degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores as these sd-shell electron capture and β-decay rates drive the URCA process. 


| 📋 TASK 1 |
|:--------|
| In `&star_jobs`, **update `inlist_accrete`** to load the `1.1Msun_ONe` model, change the initial nuclear network to `ONe.net`, and use the Suzuki rates.|

> [!NOTE]
> Remember, paths provided in the inlists are relative to the relevant `rn` executable. 

{{< details title="Hint: What variables need to be changed?" closed="true" >}}
The parameters that should be added are:
- `load_saved_model`
- `load_model_filename`
- `change_initial_net`
- `new_net_name`
- `use_suzuki_weak_rates`
{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Partial Solution" closed="true" >}}
```fortran
  ! load previous model
    load_saved_model = .true.                   !!!!! 
    load_model_filename = '1.1Msun_ONe.mod'     !!!!!

  ! net
    change_initial_net = .true.  !!!!!
    new_net_name = 'ONe.net'     !!!!!

  ! weak rates
    use_suzuki_weak_rates = .true. !!!!!
```
{{< /details >}}

Next, we want to accrete material of a given composition at a given rate. This material need not be the same composition as the surface star and may be defined as mass fractions of a variety of species. 

In `&controls`, set the accretion to 10<sup>-6</sup> M<sub>&#9737;</sub> / year of equal mass fractions of Oxygen-16 and Neon-20. Also, set the log output directory to a more descriptive name, `LOGS_ONe_1d-6`.


| 📋 TASK 1 |
|:--------|
| In `&controls`, **update `inlist_accrete`** to rename the LOGS directory to `LOGS_ONe_1d-6` and set the accretion rate to 10<sup>-6</sup> M<sub>&#9737;</sub> / year of equal mass fractions of Oxygen-16 and Neon-20|

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to both explicitly stop MESA from accreting the same composition as the surface and flag that the new accretion composition will be given as mass fractions.

{{< details title="Hint: What variables need to be changed?" closed="true" >}}
The parameters that should be added are:
- `mass_change`
- `accrete_same_as_surface`
- `accrete_given_mass_fractions`
- `num_accretion_species`
- `accretion_species_id`
- `accretion_specia_xa`
{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Hint: How is accreting material defined?" closed="true" >}}
The accretion of various species is primarily governed by two arrays: `accretion_species_id` and `accretion_specia_xa`. Additionally, `num_accretion_species` provides MESA with an expectation of the length of these two arrays. 

The `id` of a particular species is defined through abbreviated isotopic hyphen notation (minus the hyphen) as <\Chemical Symbol><\Mass Number>. For example, Selenium-80 is se80 and Nickel-56 is ni56. More information on the variety of isotopes available in MESA can be found in `$MESA_DIR/chem/public/chem_def.f90`

The `xa` is the mass fraction of the particular species, some decimal value less than or equal to 1. 

Therefore, if we wanted to accrete only Hydrogen-2, we would use:
```fortran
    ! Just H2
    num_accretion_species = 1
    accretion_species_id(1) = 'h2'
    accretion_species_xa(1) = 1d0 
```

{{< /details >}}

> [!NOTE]
> Note, arrays in fortran are 1-indexed, so the first entry in an array is array(1) and the second is array(2). 

{{< details title="Partial Solution" closed="true" >}}
```fortran
  ! accretion

    mass_change = 1d-6                     !!!!!

    accrete_same_as_surface = .false.      !!!!!
    accrete_given_mass_fractions = .true.  !!!!!

    ! O and Ne
    num_accretion_species = 2
    accretion_species_id(1) = 'o16'  !!!!!
    accretion_species_xa(1) = 0.50d0 !!!!!
    accretion_species_id(2) = 'ne20' !!!!!
    accretion_species_xa(2) = 0.50d0 !!!!!

  ! output

    log_directory = 'LOGS_ONe_1d-6' !!!!!
```

### Step 4: Building a Nuclear Network

As you may have guessed from our prior flags to change the initial net, MESA allows for the creation of custom reaction networks. The default net, `basic.net`, is a sufficient case for basic hydrogen and helium burning on the main sequence, but insufficient for more detailed nucleosynthesis studies. In general, the use of a particular network should be motivated by the physics that one seeks to explore traded against the additional computational time required on larger nets. Take a look over the format and structure of this default reaction network.

| 📋 TASK 1 |
|:--------|
| **Open `basic.net`**, peruse the included isotopes and reactions, and take note of the format |

> [!NOTE]
> The reaction networks included in MESA can be found at `$MESA_DIR/data/net_data/nets/`


In pursuit of our central question, "implode or explode", the critical physics is whether our ONe white dwarf enters thermal runaway, producing an electron capture supernova (ECSNe) or collapse under its own gravity as a collapsing ECSNe (cECSNe).  This balance requires a nuclear network that accounts for the critical electron-capture chain Neon-20 -> Fluorine-20 -> Oxygen-20 and the burning of Oxygen-16 to Silicon-28. An overview of each of these reactions is below:
| Reaction                     | Equation                                                         |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $\beta$ : Ne-20 -> F-20      | $$\ce{^{20}_{10}Ne + e- -> ^{20}_{9}F + \nu_e}$$                 |
| $\beta^-$ : F-20  -> Ne-20   | $$\ce{^{20}_{9}F -> ^{20}_{10}Ne + e- + \bar{\nu}_e}$$           |
| $\beta$ : F-20  -> O-20      | $$\ce{^{20}_{9}F + e- -> ^{20}_{8}O + \nu_e}$$                   |
| $\beta^-$ : O-20  -> F-20    | $$\ce{ ^{20}_{8}O -> ^{20}_{9}F + e- + \bar{\nu}_e}$$            |
| O-16 Burning                 | $$\ce{^{16}_{8}O + ^{16}_{8}O -> ^{28}_{14}Si + ^4_2\text{He}}$$ |


To implement this physics into our ONe white dwarf, start by creating the new `ONe.net` file in the working directory and adding the necessary isotopes.

| 📋 TASK 1 |
|:--------|
| **Create a new file `ONe.net`**, and **add the necessary isotopes** to encompass the reactions in the table above. |

> [!NOTE]
> You should also add Hydrogen (h1) to the mix! TODO, PROVIDE AN ACTUAL EXPLANATION WHY

{{< details title="Hint: What isotopes need to be added?" closed="true" >}}
The isotopes that should be added are:
- Hydrogen-1 
- Helium-4
- Oxygen-16
- Neon-20 
- Fluorine-20
- Oxygen-20 
- Silicon-28
{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Hint: What is the format to add an isotope" closed="true" >}}
To add an a group of isotopes, use 
```fortran
add_isos(
    iso_i
    iso_ii
    ...
    iso_n
	)
```

Isotopes of the same element can either be written separately on new lines, or written on the same line with mass numbers separated by a space (ie. `Zn64 \n Zn66` or `Zn 64 66` where \n is a newline)
{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Partial Solution" closed="true" >}}
```fortran
!!!!! Add Isotopes
add_isos(
     h1
	 ! for Ne20 - F20 - O20
	 ne20
	 f20
	 o20
	 ! for O ignition
	 he4
     o16
	 si28
	 )
```
{{< /details >}}


With the isotopes added, we may now move to add specific reactions. Again, the consideration of reactions should depend on the physics in question. As previously mentioned, we only need to include the four $\beta$/$\beta^-$ reactions and oxygen-16 burning, as described in the table. Add these reactions to `ONe.net`

| 📋 TASK 1 |
|:--------|
| In `ONe.net`, **add the reactions from the table above**. |

> [!NOTE]
> Use the MESA documentation to find the `reaction_handle` (ie. reaction name) format for the standard 1-to-1 weak reactions.
> For oxygen burning, the `reaction_handle` can be found in `$MESA_DIR/data/rates_data/reactions.list`.

{{< details title="Hint: What is the format of the standard 1-to-1 weak reactions " closed="true" >}}
The following information can be found [here](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/net/nets.html#description-of-net-format) under `reaction_handle`.
$\beta$ reactions (positron emission or electron capture) between reactant x and product y follow the naming r_x_wk_y 
$\beta^-$ reactons (electron emission or positron capture) between reactant x and product y follow the naming r_wk-minus_y

Note, x and y are the abbreviated isotope names (ie. Uranium-238 would be `u238`)
{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Hint: Where is the oxygen burning rate in `reactions.list`?" closed="true" >}}
It is the first entry describing 2 Oxygen-16's turning into Helium-4 and Silicon-28. The correct line can be found by searching the file for `2 o16`. The `reaction_handle` is then in the first column.
{{< /details >}}

### Step 5: History/Profile Columns

DESCRIBE WHAT HAS BEEN UNCOMMENTED IN HISTORY/PROFILE COLUMNS TODO

> [!NOTE]
> There is no task for this step! 


### Step 6: Inlist Pgstar

Within the white dwarf interior, there should be some preference for electron capture ($\beta$) over electron emission ($\beta^-$). Therefore, the rate of F-20 -> O-20 ($\lambda_{^{20}F->^{20}O}$) should be higher than the rate of O-20 -> F-20 ($\lambda_{^{20}O->^{20}F}$) at high densities.

The provided `inlist_pgstar` has been mostly preformatted to show exactly this given some values to be created in `run_star_extras.f90`. Set `profile_panels1_yaxis_name(1)` to `lambda_f20_o20` and `profile_panels1_other_yaxis_name(1)` to `lambda_o20_f20`.

| 📋 TASK 1 |
|:--------|
| In `inlist_pgstar`, **Set** `profile_panels1_yaxis_name(1)` to `lambda_f20_o20` and `profile_panels1_other_yaxis_name(1)` to `lambda_o20_f20`   |

> [!NOTE]
> With these inclusions, the provided `inlist_pgstar` will be expecting four new profile columns: `eps_nuc_neu_total`, `non_nuc_neu`, `lambda_f20_o20`, `lambda_o20_f20`

> [!WARNING]
> Don't forget to save your changes!

### Step 7: Run Star Extras

Now that `inlist_pgstar` is expecting four new profile columns, we need to fill these columns with data. The general format of `run_star_extras.f90`


With our inlists prepped, the last thing to do before running the model is to set up these new profile columns for 

| 📋 TASK 1 |
|:--------|
| In `run_star_extras`, **Add** an additional history column for neutrino luminosity ...  |

> [!WARNING]
> Don't forget to save your changes to run_star_extras!


### Step 8: Run the Model!

| 📋 TASK 1 |
|:--------|
| **Run** the model! Observe the...  |


Review the central density of the model at ignition. Using this value and Figure 8 from Holas+26[^2] (below), assuming that ignition is perfectly centered, does your model explode or implode?

*Figure 8, from Holas+26* [^2]


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not forget to `./clean`, then `./mk`, then `./rn`




### Step 9: Plan for the future (Update nuclear network and run)

Add the following nuclei to the model:


| 📋 TASK 1 |
|:--------|
| **Update** `ONe.net` to include the above inert nuclei.  |


Now, the stopping condition should be modified to save a copy of the model right when the density crosses into thresholds that will be more... exciting. Set the stopping condition such that the final model will be produced when

Run through stopping condition

| 📋 TASK 1 |
|:--------|
| **Run** the model (Again)! Observe the...  |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not forget to `./clean`, then `./mk`, then `./rn`


## BONUS: Magnetization Station

Magnetic fields can alter the interior structure of white dwarfs, driving higher masses, while increasing instability. Modify the magnetic field of the star in 5 regimes. Track the different final masses at ignition.
