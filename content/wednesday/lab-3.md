# Minilab 3: They all go broke

So far we have changed the nuclear net to include more reactions, and looked at the effect of Urca cooling from the $^{23}\rm{Na}$-$^{23}\rm{Ne}$ pair on the stellar structure. 

Now we will do a crowdsourcing to look at how the evolution changes with the accretion rate $\dot{M}$, reaction networks, and reaction rates. 
The goal is to look at how they change the core properties at the onset of oxygen ignition, because whether an electron-capture supernova undergoes a thermonuclear explosion or core-collapse (implosion) is extremely sensitive to the central density. 

### Step 0: Start up

| 📋 TASK 1 |
|:--------|
| **Download** the starting point from the [Google Drive]( FIXLINK ) to a local working directory. |

The starting point is a very simple setup. 


### Step 1: Pick a model

| 📋 TASK 2 |
|:--------|
|  Go to the spreadsheet [here]( FIXLINK ). Pick any combination of the accretion rate, reaction network and reaction rates provided. Users with more cores should pick more computationally expensive ones. |


### Step 2: Changing the accretion rate

| 📋 TASK 3 |
|:--------|
| Edit `inlist_accrete` to set the accretion rate that you chose. |

{{< details title="What variable needs to be changed?" closed="true" >}}



{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Partial solution" closed="true" >}}

In `&controls`, set `mass_change = <your value>`. 

{{< /details >}}

### Step 3: Changing your net

Our base net `ONe.net` contains the basic reactions for oxygen ignition, namely the reaction $^{16}\rm{O} + \,^{16}\rm{O} \to \alpha+\,^{28}\rm{Si}$, and the weak reacion chain $^{20}\rm{Ne} \to \,^{20}\rm{F} \to \, ^{20}\rm{O}$. Depending on the net you chose in the spreadsheet, you will modify your net accordingly to include more weak reactions. 

| 📋 TASK 3 |
|:--------|
| **Edit `my.net`** to set the reaction network. **Click on the tabs below** to review the instructions for your specific net. |

{{< details title="ONe.net" closed="true" >}}

Nothing to do. 

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="ONeMg.net" closed="true" >}}

{{< details title="Partial solution" closed="true" >}}

Nothing to do.

### Step 4: Changing the rates



Most of you will be using the Suzuki rates. However, more updated reaction rates may be available as more experimental work is done, and MESA has the flexibility to change the reaction rates.

#### Custom rates
